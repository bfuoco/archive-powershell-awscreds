# AWS Credentials Switcher

This was a small PowerShell script that I wrote to switch AWS credentials files when
running commands with the AWS CLI. There is no longer any need for this, because the
AWS CLI now supports named profiles: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

Alternatively, perhaps it supported named profiles at the time and I simply didn't
realize that was a feature of the CLI :p.
